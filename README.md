# franklin

`franklin` is a small robot prototype driven by a Raspberry Pi 4 that reads input data from various sensors 
(camera, microphone, accelerometer and temperature/humdity sensor) and responds to environmental stimulus 
by playing animations on an RGB LED matrix display and playing sound through a speaker.
