# franklin

`franklin` is a small robot prototype driven by a Raspberry Pi 4 that reads input data from various sensors 
(camera, microphone, accelerometer and temperature/humdity sensor) and responds to environmental stimulus 
by playing animations on an RGB LED matrix display and playing sound through a speaker.

###### Devloper Update - 7/13/2021

`franklin` is alive, and he's a pink octopus! `franklin`'s camera and LED matrix display are working, and
`franklin` now has an idle animation.
